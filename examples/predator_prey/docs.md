# Predator-Prey Simulation Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for our Python-based Predator-Prey Simulation. This documentation will guide you through the functionalities and usage of our simulation.

**Objective**: Our simulation aims to replicate the dynamics of a predator-prey ecosystem, allowing you to explore the interactions and outcomes between these two species.

**Version**: [Your version number]

**Author**: [Your Name]

## Assumptions

Our simulation is built upon certain assumptions:

- **Homogeneous Environment**: We assume a homogeneous environment with no spatial variations, such as differences in resource availability or terrain.

- **Constant Parameters**: Parameters like reproduction rates, predation rates, and hunger rates are considered constant throughout the simulation. In reality, these factors may change due to environmental conditions.

- **Instantaneous Interactions**: Predation and reproduction events are modeled as instantaneous events, ignoring the complexities of real-world predator-prey interactions.

## Citations

Our simulation draws inspiration from various ecological models and concepts. The following references have been influential in our model's design:

- **Gause's Competitive Exclusion Principle**: Gause's principle (1934) provides the foundation for modeling competitive interactions between species.

- **Lotka-Volterra Equations**: The Lotka-Volterra equations (1920) are fundamental in predator-prey modeling and are adapted for our simulation.

- **Holling's Functional Response**: We integrate different types of functional responses from the work of Holling (1959) to model predator-prey interactions.

- **Ecological Literature**: Our simulation's assumptions and ecological concepts are inspired by various ecological literature, which helps create a simplified yet informative model.

## Equations and Concepts

Our simulation is based on the Lotka-Volterra equations, a classic predator-prey model. The fundamental equations are as follows:

### For Prey:

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = r_P \cdot P - c \cdot P \cdot H
$$

- $P$ represents the prey population.
- $r_P$ is the prey reproduction rate.
- $c$ is the predation rate.
- $H$ is the predator population.

### For Predators:

$$
\frac{dH}{dt} = -r_H \cdot H + e \cdot c \cdot P \cdot H
$$

- $H$ represents the predator population.
- $r_H$ is the predator death rate in the absence of prey.
- $e$ is the predator efficiency in converting captured prey to reproduction.
- $P$ is the prey population.

These equations describe the dynamics of the predator-prey relationship in our simulation.



## Parameters and Metrics

In our predator-prey simulation, a set of parameters and metrics play a vital role in defining the simulation's behavior and evaluating its performance. Understanding and adjusting these variables is essential for customizing the simulation to meet specific requirements.

### Parameters

1. **Initial Population**: Determine the initial population of predators and prey in the simulation. The ratio between the two species significantly influences the dynamics of the ecosystem.

2. **Reproduction Rate**: Set the rate at which prey reproduce. Higher reproduction rates can lead to increased prey populations.

3. **Predation Rate**: Define how frequently predators hunt and catch prey. Higher predation rates result in a faster decline of prey populations.

4. **Predator Hunger Rate**: Specify how often predators need to feed to maintain their population. A higher hunger rate can lead to a more dynamic predator population.

5. **Simulation Time Step**: Set the duration of each time step in the simulation. Smaller time steps result in more granular, detailed simulations.

6. **Environment Size and Shape**: Customize the dimensions and shape of the environment in which the simulation takes place. Different shapes and sizes can impact predator-prey interactions.

### Metrics

1. **Population Trends**: Monitor the population trends of both predators and prey over time. This provides insight into the dynamics of the ecosystem.

2. **Survival Rate**: Calculate the proportion of prey that escapes predation. A higher survival rate may indicate a healthier prey population.

3. **Predator Efficiency**: Measure how efficiently predators capture prey. This metric helps evaluate the success of predators in maintaining their population.

4. **Time to Extinction**: Record the time it takes for either the predator or prey population to go extinct. This metric reveals the sustainability of the ecosystem.

5. **Biodiversity Index**: Compute an index that reflects the overall biodiversity in the ecosystem, considering both predator and prey species.

### Customization

You can fine-tune these parameters to simulate various predator-prey scenarios, ranging from stable coexistence to predator-driven extinction. Adjusting these parameters allows you to explore the impact of different factors on the ecosystem and adapt the simulation to specific research questions or educational purposes.

When analyzing metrics, consider the ecological dynamics and the stability of the predator-prey relationship. These metrics can help you gain insights into how changes in parameters affect the long-term health of the ecosystem.
