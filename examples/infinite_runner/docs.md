# Infinite Runner Game Simulation Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for our Python-based Infinite Runner Game Simulation. This documentation will guide you through the functionalities and usage of our model. 

**Objective**: Our simulation aims to replicate the gameplay experience of popular infinite runner games like Subway Surfers.

**Version**: [Your version number]

**Author**: [Your Name]



## Assumptions

Our simulation makes the following assumptions:

- The game environment is two-dimensional.
- The character's movements are restricted to jumping and sliding.
- Obstacles and power-ups appear at predefined intervals.
- Collision detection is based on basic geometric shapes.


## Formulae and Concepts

Our simulation is based on the following core concepts:

- Character movement: [Explain the mechanics of character movement]
- Obstacle generation: [Describe how obstacles are generated]
- Scoring: [Explain how scoring works]
- Power-ups: [Discuss the power-up system]

## Similar Games (e.g., Subway Surfers)

Subway Surfers is a popular infinite runner game that shares some similarities with our simulation. Here are a few points of comparison:

- Gameplay: Both games involve continuous running, jumping, and dodging obstacles.
- Environment: Our game environment shares a similar urban and subway theme.
- Scoring: Scoring mechanisms are inspired by Subway Surfers' coin collection system.

## Parameters and Metrics

In our infinite runner game simulation, various parameters and metrics play a crucial role in defining the game's behavior and evaluating its performance. Understanding and adjusting these variables is key to customizing the game to your specific requirements.

### Parameters

1. **Character Speed**: This parameter controls the speed at which the character runs in the game. Adjusting this value changes the game's difficulty level.

2. **Obstacle Frequency**: Determine how often obstacles appear on the game path. A higher frequency increases the challenge.

3. **Jump Height**: Set the maximum height the character can reach when jumping. This influences the character's ability to clear obstacles.

4. **Power-up Spawn Rate**: Define how often power-ups appear in the game. Altering this rate affects power-up availability.

5. **Game Environment**: Specify the background and theme of the game environment, including graphics and audio settings.

6. **Collision Detection Precision**: Customize the precision of collision detection, which can influence the fairness of the game.

### Metrics

1. **Score**: The score represents the player's performance and is calculated based on the distance covered and coins collected. Higher scores indicate better gameplay.

2. **Distance Traveled**: This metric measures how far the character has run in the game. It's a primary indicator of player progress.

3. **Coins Collected**: Track the number of coins collected during gameplay. Coins are often used to purchase power-ups or unlock features.

4. **Time Survived**: Record the duration of gameplay in real-time. It provides insights into player endurance.

5. **High Score**: Keep a record of the highest score achieved in the game. This metric can be motivating for players.

### Customization

You can fine-tune these parameters to modify the gameplay experience, making the game more challenging or more accessible based on your preferences or user feedback. Adjusting these parameters allows you to create different levels of difficulty and adapt the game to your target audience.

When analyzing metrics, consider player engagement and performance. You can use these metrics to identify areas for improvement, evaluate the success of game balance changes, or set benchmarks for high scores in your game.

For more details on how to customize parameters and analyze metrics, refer to the [Configuration and Analytics](#configuration-and-analytics) section of this documentation.
